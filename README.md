# Dictionary-App
A simple Python dictionary application to prompt user for a word and then show the definition(s) of the given word. The program takes a JSON file containing all of the words and definitions. If the user enters a word not in the JSON file, the program will give an error, saying the word was not found. The program will run until the user enters 'q'.
